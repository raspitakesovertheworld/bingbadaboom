The Bingbadaboom System Stability Monitor

This project was created out of the need to measure system stability on Linux. There currently is no other measurement of how stable a system runs, how many crashes it has had, and in Linux, there was not even a way to tell if the system crashed at all, it just restarts and does not let you know about this important fact.

The idea of Bingbadaboom is also to make systems comparable. Years back, I noticed that my Android smartphone was crashing a little too often and I wanted to track this and compare it to my much more reliable Linux desktops, laptops and servers.
